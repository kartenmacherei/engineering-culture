There are some fundamental practices and techniques that every software engineer at celebrate should have enough experience with in order to know when to apply them to the problem they are solving. This does not mean we only hire engineers who tick all the boxes on our checklist. It also does not mean that we apply all of these practices to all of our projects. 

It does mean that every software engineer must have the opportunity to learn and practice them at celebrate, so they have a whole box of modern, proven tools at their disposal and can make educated decisions on when to use which.

## Engineering Manager

Taken from http://www.engineeringladders.com[^1]:

> With the relationships that have been built and nurtured within the team, the EM provides great value to the Leadership Team. They implicitly understand the pain points being experienced by the team and should be regularly surfacing and communicating these issues.

> Engineering Managers are constantly in the position to identify high performers that need to be nurtured and lower performers that need assistance. Recruitment and capacity planning should start from this position. Not only when looking at bringing new talent into the team but more importantly, recognizing the unique career objectives along with how they can be accommodated and encouraged for each member of the team.

> Most importantly of all, the team needs to feel fully and unconditionally supported by the Engineering Manager. They are their safety layer. They provide guidance when there is uncertainty, and protection when there is a threat. This may sound dramatic, but changing scopes and shifting deadlines are a genuine threat to morale and therefore the productiveness of the team. The Engineering Manager is the provider of context when there are changes and the voice of reason when there is debate.

# Measuring Success

It is the job of the leadership team to build high-performing teams. In order to keep track of how good of a job the leads are doing, we need reasonable metrics which should be available to the whole company. The purpose of those public metrics must always be to track teams, never individuals.

We do not want to foster a culture where people compete and optimize for a specific metric to hack the performance evaluation. Metrics can still support the growth of individual engineers, but those should be known only to the engineer and their lead, so they can track the progress of the development goals they agreed on.

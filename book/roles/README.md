# Roles

For an engineering culture like the one described in this guide to work, a couple of roles are necessary.

## Product Manager

- Turns a problem into a solution together with the team
- Knows the "why" and develops the "what", leaving the "how" to the team

## Software Engineer

- technical expert
    - usually specialised, e.g. "Backend", "Frontend"
- understands the "why" and the "what" to develop the "how"
    - negotiates scope
- not isolated from customers and stakeholders


## Engineering Manager

> With the relationships that have been built and nurtured within the team, the EM provides great value to the Leadership Team. They implicitly understand the pain points being experienced by the team and should be regularly surfacing and communicating these issues.

> Engineering Managers are constantly in the position to identify high performers that need to be nurtured and lower performers that need assistance. Recruitment and capacity planning should start from this position. Not only when looking at bringing new talent into the team but more importantly, recognizing the unique career objectives along with how they can be accommodated and encouraged for each member of the team.

> Most importantly of all, the team needs to feel fully and unconditionally supported by the Engineering Manager. They are their safety layer. They provide guidance when there is uncertainty, and protection when there is a threat. This may sound dramatic, but changing scopes and shifting deadlines are a genuine threat to morale and therefore the productiveness of the team. The Engineering Manager is the provider of context when there are changes and the voice of reason when there is debate.

> Role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support.

## Stakeholder

- Are able to represent the customer, so they can tell us if a solution is valuable for the customer
- Are sometimes also the customer as they also raise problems they need a solution for

## Customer

- We talk to customers to understand their problems, which we derive the "why" from

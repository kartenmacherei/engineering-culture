## We believe in empowered teams

To take pride and joy in the things we finish, we need to be able to shape our work and have full transparency on its effects. We believe that Empowered Product Teams as described by Marty Cagan are the way to achieve exactly that.

According to Cagan, Empowered Product Teams build solutions that are _valuable_ (customers benefit from them), _viable_ (they meet the needs of the business), _usable_ (customers understand and enjoy using them) and _feasible_ (technical effort and long-term maintenance are in relation to the value). The teams shape and own the solution they build for a given problem and can therefore also be held accountable for their results.[^1]

This kind of empowerment can provide the perfect environment for intrinsically motivated people. Software Engineering is a field offering endless growth opportunities, and leveraging those can happen best in an environment that gives us a clear _purpose_, _autonomy_ and the means to achieve _mastery_[^2]

## We work collaboratively

Writing code should be a collaborative process, pair programming, mob programming. We reduce the need for asynchronous Pull Requests and instead have the quickest possible feedback loop through writing code together. We apply Ship/Show/Ask[^1] in order to only use Pull Requests as a blocking gate for shipping something when necessary while still keeping code reviews as an integral part of sharing knowledge and receiving feedback.  

Working together on a task should be the default.

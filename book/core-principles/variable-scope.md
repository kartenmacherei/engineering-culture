## We cut scope, not quality

Our work happens in a triangle of quality, time and scope. We deliberately limit time and any cutback on quality will make our lives harder in the future. This leaves us with one variable: scope. We should always strive to find the smallest possible scope to meet the needs of our customers and ourselves. We do this constantly before and also while we work on something [^1].

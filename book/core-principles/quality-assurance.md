## Quality Assurance is an integral part of our work

> Inspection does not improve the quality, nor guarantee quality. Inspection is too late. The quality, good or bad, is already in the product. As Harold F. Dodge said, 'You can not inspect quality into a product.'[^1]

We do not hand over seemingly finished features to QA for testing. Instead, our QA Specialists work with us and help us to apply the right testing strategy before, during and after writing code in order to build a product of high quality. 

As explained before, maintaining a high level of quality is essential to stay agile and deliver value at a constant pace.

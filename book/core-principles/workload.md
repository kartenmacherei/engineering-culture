## We take responsibility for our workload

- more people will not magically solve problems, it's all about prioritization 
  - goal: do more with less people
- we are the owners of our time and our calendars
- it's up to us to reduce maintenance load to a reasonable level (see value vs. maintenance). 
- automate everything! We avoid unnecessary work to focus on the things we do best.
- think twice if we need to build custom software to solve a problem
  - example: SaaS > PaaS > self-hosted

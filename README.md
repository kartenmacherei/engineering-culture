# Engineering Culture @ celebrate

This repo holds the source for our engineering culture guide that is available [as a website](https://kartenmacherei.github.io/engineering-culture/) and [as an ebook](https://github.com/kartenmacherei/engineering-culture/releases/latest).

[HonKit](https://github.com/honkit/honkit) is used to generate the various formats. 

## Working on content

All content is written in Markdown. If you want to make changes to the book's structure, edit SUMMARY.md, following the

If you want to build the PDF locally, you will need [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

# Introduction

## Why this guide?

- the clearer we make where we want to be the easier it will be to get there
- clear expectations
    - helps with performance evaluation and growth paths
- we can share this with anyone interested in working with us - do our values match?
    - we have a culture fit, but not an engineering culture fit

## Culture can not be created

We cannot simply "create" the engineering culture that we want[^1]. A culture can be fostered, but it is like its own living being that will constantly change and evolve. We can only guide its evolvement into a desired direction.

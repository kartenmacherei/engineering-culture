## Quality Assurance is an integral part of our work

> Inspection does not improve the quality, nor guarantee quality. Inspection is too late. The quality, good or bad, is already in the product. As Harold F. Dodge said, 'You can not inspect quality into a product.'[^1]

Maintaining a high level of quality is not only essential for ensuring our customers have a delightful experience when using our products, but also for staying agile and delivering value at a constant pace. To achieve this level, we do not hand over seemingly finished features to QA for testing. Instead, we work closely with our QA Specialists to apply the right testing strategy before, during and after writing code in order to build a product of high quality. 

We try to discover bugs as early as possible. This is usually long before we start writing actual code, when we shape our solution. Many issues stem from design flaws and can be prevented by spending enough time in the design phase.

For each system we build, we have the test pyramid[^2] in mind to focus on the right kinds of tests.

We automate testing as much as possible. We constantly add regression tests to our systems when we discover bugs, so that we can easily prove a fix works as intended and to make sure that the same bug will not make it to production again.

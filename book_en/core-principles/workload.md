## We take responsibility for our workload

Our overall goal should be to constantly improve our tools and processes so that we can achieve more with fewer people while sustaining an exceptionally great work-life balance.

Adding more people to our teams will not magically solve our problems if we do not prioritize our work properly, so we need to find the sweet spot between a too large, hard to maintain team with a big management overhead and a too small team that is constantly overwhelmed by tasks we absolutely have to do.

We are the owners of our calendars and of the time we spend at work. It is up to us individually to set boundaries and openly address overwhelm and stress. We make room for learning, experimentation and other activities that do not directly relate to the work we do in our teams.

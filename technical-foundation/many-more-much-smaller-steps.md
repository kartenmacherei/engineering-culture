## Many More Much Smaller Steps

The key to a consistent performance and a high degree of agility is breaking work down into the smallest meaningful (not necessarily valuable!) steps. The smaller the steps, the easier it will be to take them and the better we can react to changes. A step can be translated to a code change that meets all our standards, can go live and does not make the application worse[^1].

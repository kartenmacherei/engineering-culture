The teams shape and own the solution they build for a given problem and can therefore also be held accountable for their results.1\nThis kind of empowerment can provide the perfect environment for intrinsically motivated people.

What was a good rule to follow for the past years may not be relevant or even hurtful for our future. We must be willing to challenge existing rules and abandon them in favor of something new, and that is not at all as simple as it sounds. We constantly need to balance stability and disruption - if we change our rules too easily and too quickly, we will not make progress. If we stick to established practices for too long and not innovate in the way we work, we will lose our competitive advantages.  \nWe stick to the rules we make, until we decide to change them\n\nThe culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior the leader is willing to tolerate.2\n\nThis holds true for our engineering culture as well.

Clean Architecture helps us to group our code into layers and adhere to the \"D\" in SOLID: Dependency Inversion 2, which is one key element for keeping our code componentized should we ever see the need to move something out into its own service. The more we build our applications this way, the easier it will also be to find our way around projects we haven't worked with before.\n\n1. https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html ↩\n\n\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle ↩\n\n"},"technical-foundation/trunk-based-development.html":{"url":"technical-foundation/trunk-based-development.html","title":"Trunk-Based Development","keywords":"","body":"Trunk-Based Development\nThis technique encourages (or rather enforces) making many small (we'll call them \"atomic\" later) commits towards the main branch of a repository instead of working in long-living (i.e. more than a day) feature branches. Since many features can potentially take a larger number of those commits until they are ready for the customer, we need to work with feature branches (also covered later). It also requires us to have a fast and robust integration process, as otherwise we would risk having (and eventually shipping) broken code in the main branch. On the plus side we avoid \"merge hell\" when trying to integrate large feature branches.\n"},"technical-foundation/test-driven-development.html":{"url":"technical-foundation/test-driven-development.html","title":"Test-Driven Development","keywords":"","body":"Test-Driven Development (TDD)\nTest-driven development has been practiced for way longer than you may think. The code for the Apollo 11 mission was developed in this way, so it's been around since the 60s (find source). TDD forces us to think about what we want to do before writing code - that sounds simple, but it actually is a very brutal change for many software developers (I intentionally did not write \"engineer\" here), as many will rather write code as part of their though process. This can lead to suboptimal solutions. TDD has very simple rules to follow1:\n\nYou are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.\nYou are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.\nYou are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.\n\nAnd as with every rule, there can be exceptions. Event Kent Beck himself does not follow those rules every single time 2. The key benefit of TDD is putting the thought process before writing actual code and that along holds a lot of value.\nThis approach plays along nicely with atomic commits.\n\n1. https://localheinz.com/articles/2018/02/01/test-coverage-is-a-meaningless-metric/ ↩\n\n\n2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565 ↩\n\n"},"technical-foundation/many-much-more-smaller-steps.html":{"url":"technical-foundation/many-much-more-smaller-steps.html","title":"Many Much More Smaller Steps","keywords":"","body":"Many Much More Smaller Steps\nThe key to a consistent performance and a high degree of agility is breaking work down into the smallest meaningful (not necessarily valuable!) steps.

They are their safety layer. They provide guidance when there is uncertainty, and protection when there is a threat. This may sound dramatic, but changing scopes and shifting deadlines are a genuine threat to morale and therefore the productiveness of the team.

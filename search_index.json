corporate culture, engineering culture is a shared set of behaviors, attitudes, values, and practices of engineers. They impact how your engineers act, make decisions, and how they feel.\n-- https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/our-purpose/the-importance-of-a-strong-engineering-culture\n\nWhy we need this guide\nAs a company, we believe in the superiority of autonomous, purpose-driven teams that can take their own decisions, but we also know that we are on a never-ending quest to live up to our ideals. The better we understand what those ideals are and why we strive for them, the easier it will be to get there. \nThis guide should give you a pretty clear picture of how we want to work at celebrate - no matter if you have worked at celebrate for several years already, have recently joined or are interested in joining us. After reading, you should be able to answer the following question: \nIs this in line with my beliefs and how I would like to work as a Software Engineer?\nIf the answer is \"yes\", you can rely on the support of the whole company with your continuous pursuit of growth. If the answer is \"no\", celebrate might not be the perfect place for you, and that's okay. No environment can satisfy the needs of everyone, and just because we have decided to work a certain way that differs from your beliefs does not mean either side is right or better. \nThe principles presented in this guide can also be helpful for finding your professional growth path at celebrate. Together with your lead, you can identify areas that you would like to focus on, and you can rest assured that there will be plenty of opportunities to increase your knowledge and develop your practical skills as a Software Engineer.\nCulture can not be created\nWe cannot simply \"create\" the engineering culture that we want1. A culture can be fostered, but it is like a living being that will constantly change and evolve. We can only gently guide its evolution into a desired direction by being role models for others and holding ourselves accountable to our actions.\n\n1. https://dreadfullyposh.com/writing/sorry-but-you-cant-just-create-a-company-culture ↩\n\n"},"core-principles/":{"url":"core-principles/","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Core Principles\nThe principles laid out here guide us in our daily work as software engineers.

We believe that Empowered Product Teams as described by Marty Cagan are the way to achieve exactly that.\nAccording to Cagan, Empowered Product Teams build solutions that are valuable (customers benefit from them), viable (they meet the needs of the business), usable (customers understand and enjoy using them) and feasible (technical effort and long-term maintenance are in relation to the value). The teams shape and own the solution they build for a given problem and can therefore also be held accountable for their results.1\nThis kind of empowerment can provide the perfect environment for intrinsically motivated people. Software Engineering is a field offering endless growth opportunities, and leveraging those can happen best in an environment that gives us a clear purpose, autonomy and the means to achieve mastery2\n\n1.

We deliberately limit time and any cutback on quality will make our lives harder in the future. This leaves us with one variable: scope. We should always strive to find the smallest possible scope to meet the needs of our customers and ourselves. We do this constantly before and also while we work on something 1.\nQuality is not optional\nMaking sacrifices on the quality of the solutions will build comes always comes at a price. \"Technical debt\" is a common term in software development, and using it bears the risk of normalizing the violation of the rules we established for good reasons. \"Debt\" implies that we have taken a loan that we need to pay back some time in the future, but everyone working in this field has experienced that happens very rarely. Ultimately that means the negative effects of those quality cuts (e.g. missing tests or incomplete automation) will accumulate to an extent that will almost completely keep us busy with maintenance and a never-ending input stream of bugs. \n\n(Placeholder chart with made-up numbers). Low quality releases will gradually lead to a high share of maintenance and bug-fixing, eventually blocking us from creating new value for our customers. Adding value can then only be accomplished by adding more Software Engineers to the teams. Our goal must be to keep maintenance load on a reasonable level instead. \nNot only will bugfixes become incredible expensive in terms of effort and customer impact when they are discovered after release2, but they destroy our focus. Some bugs can seemingly wait, so we dump them into backlogs, hoping to get to them at some point, but in the end that is a fight we can only lose. The better we shape our solutions and the closer we work together on them from the very beginning (read: before writing any code), the better the outcome will be. \n\n1. https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#fixed-time-variable-scope ↩\n\n\n2. https://deepsource.io/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs/ ↩\n\n"},"core-principles/industry-standards.html":{"url":"core-principles/industry-standards.html","title":"Industry Standards","keywords":"","body":"We follow industry standards, as long as we have not discovered something that works better for us\nWe base our tech stack and our processes on proven standards first.

What was a good rule to follow for the past years may not be relevant or even hurtful for our future. We must be willing to challenge existing rules and abandon them in favor of something new, and that is not at all as simple as it sounds. We constantly need to balance stability and disruption - if we change our rules too easily and too quickly, we will not make progress. If we stick to established practices for too long and not innovate in the way we work, we will lose our competitive advantages.  \nWe stick to the rules we make, until we decide to change them\n\nThe culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior the leader is willing to tolerate.2\n\nThis holds true for our engineering culture as well.

TDD forces us to think about what we want to do before writing code - that sounds simple, but it actually is a very brutal change for many software developers (I intentionally did not write \"engineer\" here), as many will rather write code as part of their though process. This can lead to suboptimal solutions. TDD has very simple rules to follow1:\n\nYou are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.\nYou are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.\nYou are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.\n\nAnd as with every rule, there can be exceptions. Event Kent Beck himself does not follow those rules every single time 2. The key benefit of TDD is putting the thought process before writing actual code and that along holds a lot of value.\nThis approach plays along nicely with atomic commits.\n\n1. https://localheinz.com/articles/2018/02/01/test-coverage-is-a-meaningless-metric/ ↩\n\n\n2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565 ↩\n\n"},"technical-foundation/many-much-more-smaller-steps.html":{"url":"technical-foundation/many-much-more-smaller-steps.html","title":"Many Much More Smaller Steps","keywords":"","body":"Many Much More Smaller Steps\nThe key to a consistent performance and a high degree of agility is breaking work down into the smallest meaningful (not necessarily valuable!) steps.

They are their safety layer. They provide guidance when there is uncertainty, and protection when there is a threat. This may sound dramatic, but changing scopes and shifting deadlines are a genuine threat to morale and therefore the productiveness of the team.

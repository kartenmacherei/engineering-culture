corporate culture, engineering culture is a shared set of behaviors, attitudes, values, and practices of engineers. They impact how your engineers act, make decisions, and how they feel.\n-- https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/our-purpose/the-importance-of-a-strong-engineering-culture\n\nWhy we need this guide\nAs a company, we believe in the superiority of autonomous, purpose-driven teams. Working on software products in autonomous teams has certain requirements, and one of those is a culture of collaboration, trust and accountability. We know that we are on a never-ending quest to live up to our ideals. The better we understand what those ideals are and why we strive for them, the easier it will be to get there. \nThis guide should give you a pretty clear picture of how we want to work at celebrate - no matter if you have worked at celebrate for several years already, have recently joined or are interested in joining us. After reading, you should be able to answer the following question: \nIs this in line with my beliefs and how I would like to work as a Software Engineer?\nIf the answer is \"yes\", you can rely on the support of the whole company with your continuous pursuit of growth. If the answer is \"no\", celebrate might not be the perfect place for you, and that's okay. No environment can satisfy the needs of everyone, and just because we have decided to work a certain way that differs from your beliefs does not mean either side is right or better. \nThe principles presented in this guide can also be helpful for finding your professional growth path at celebrate. Together with your lead, you can identify areas that you would like to focus on, and you can rest assured that there will be plenty of opportunities to increase your knowledge and develop your practical skills as a Software Engineer.\nCulture cannot be created\nWe cannot simply \"create\" the engineering culture that we want1. A culture can be fostered, but it is like a living being that will constantly change and evolve. We can only gently guide its evolution into a desired direction by being role models for others and holding ourselves accountable for our actions.\n\n1. https://dreadfullyposh.com/writing/sorry-but-you-cant-just-create-a-company-culture ↩\n\n"},"core-principles/":{"url":"core-principles/","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Core Principles\nThe principles laid out here guide us in our daily work as software engineers.

We believe that Empowered Product Teams as described by Marty Cagan are the way to achieve exactly that.\nAccording to Cagan, Empowered Product Teams build solutions that are valuable (customers benefit from them), viable (they meet the needs of the business), usable (customers understand and enjoy using them) and feasible (technical effort and long-term maintenance are in relation to the value). The teams shape and own the solution they build for a given problem and can therefore also be held accountable for their results.1\nThis is in line with the views of Daniel H. Pink2: we as a company cannot “create” motivation. People are motivated. Instead, we can only eliminate demotivators by creating an environment that gives clear purpose, autonomy and the means to achieve mastery.\nThis inherently creates an environment that is incompatible to people not finding value in purpose, autonomy or mastery.\n\n1.

High quality standards are essential for keeping our pace and not make the lives of our future selves harder. We deliberately limit time to maintain our focus. This leaves us with one variable: scope. We should always strive to find the smallest possible scope to meet the needs of our customers and ourselves. We do this constantly before and also while we work on something 1.\nQuality is not optional\nMaking sacrifices on the quality of the solutions we build always comes at a price. \"Technical debt\" is a common term in software development, and using it bears the risk of normalizing the violation of the rules we established for good reasons. \"Debt\" implies that we have taken a loan that we need to pay back some time in the future, but everyone working in this field has made the experience that that happens very rarely. Ultimately that means the negative effects of those quality cuts (e.g. missing tests or incomplete automation) will accumulate to an extent that will almost completely keep us busy with maintenance and a never-ending input stream of bugs. \n\nLow quality releases will gradually lead to a high share of maintenance and bug-fixing, limiting us in delivering value for our customers. Adding value can then only be accomplished by adding more Software Engineers to the teams, which introduces new problems. Onboarding new people to a legacy codebase can take time and is not very motivating, but keeping the standing team busy with maintenance and letting the new people build shiny new stuff will also lead to a significant drop in motivation. So our goal must be to keep maintenance load on a reasonable level instead. \nNot only do bugfixes become incredibly expensive in terms of effort and customer impact when they are discovered after release2, but they destroy our focus. Some bugs can seemingly wait, so we dump them into backlogs, hoping to get to them at some point, but in the end that is a fight we can only lose. The better we shape our solutions and the closer we work together on them from the very beginning (read: before writing any code), the better the outcome will be. \n\n1. https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#fixed-time-variable-scope ↩\n\n\n2. https://deepsource.io/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs/ ↩\n\n"},"core-principles/industry-standards.html":{"url":"core-principles/industry-standards.html","title":"Industry Standards","keywords":"","body":"We follow industry standards, as long as we have not discovered something that works better for us\nWe base our tech stack and our processes on proven standards first.

Tolerating behavior that is clearly in violation of the way we want to work and treat each other will inevitably damage our culture and ultimately the joy of working at celebrate.\nWhat brought us here won't get us there\n\nIt should be noted that the main reason for the Romans becoming masters of the world was that, having fought successively against all peoples, they always gave up their own practices as soon as they found better ones.2\n\nIn an ever-changing environment like ours, it is crucial to adapt to new circumstances. What was a good rule to follow for the past years may not be relevant or even harmful for our future. We must be willing to challenge existing rules and abandon them in favor of something new, and that is not at all as simple as it sounds. We constantly need to balance stability and disruption - if we change our rules too easily and too quickly, we will lose direction and with that also motivation. Without that, we will not make progress on the things that matter.

Having the same number of tasks in progress as there are members in a team is an anti-pattern that is usually driven either by the fear of not having enough to do for everyone in the team or by the amount of topics that we see lying around in our backlog seeming so large that we feel the pressure to take on as many things as possible at the same time.  \n"},"core-principles/collaboration.html":{"url":"core-principles/collaboration.html","title":"Collaboration First","keywords":"","body":"We work collaboratively\nWriting code should be a collaborative process by default, otherwise we would not need teams.

Not everything we do can be based on numbers.\nHypothesis-Driven (Product) Development\nMany decisions we take when designing solutions are based on assumptions. Some of them will be right, some of them completely off. \nIf we make explicit what those assumptions are by phrasing them as hypotheses, we can find ways to verify them without even writing any code at all. \nThis is not only helpful when shaping a new feature but also when debugging an issue. We come up with a hypothesis about the cause for the issue and then think about ways to disprove it - usually it is easier to find reasons why the hypothesis is NOT true instead of trying to prove that it is true. With this approach we can quickly eliminate possible causes just by talking to domain experts before going too deep into fixing the problem.  \nBarry O'Reilly coined the term \"Hypothesis-Driven Development\", in which every feature we add to a system is based on a hypothesis with an expected outcome and a way to measure its results. \n\nAs the software development industry continues to mature, we now have an opportunity to leverage improved capabilities such as Continuous Design and Delivery to maximize our potential to learn quickly what works and what does not. By taking an experimental approach to information discovery, we can more rapidly test our solutions against the problems we have identified in the products or services we are attempting to build.1\n\nThis method can bridge the gap between our intuition and the need for dependable data. We phrase our hypothesis (which can be based on intuition) and do the change that will give us the data to verify it. That change can be a fake-door test, a customer survey or the minimum viable version of a new feature - whichever we need to learn from the data if we were right - and if we were, we can further invest into the feature. \nAs a side effect, we subconsciously train our intuition to make better assumptions in the future. \n\n\n1. https://barryoreilly.com/explore/blog/how-to-implement-hypothesis-driven-development/ ↩\n\n"},"core-principles/quality-assurance.html":{"url":"core-principles/quality-assurance.html","title":"Quality Assurance is integral","keywords":"","body":"Quality Assurance is an integral part of our work\n\nInspection does not improve the quality, nor guarantee quality. Inspection is too late. The quality, good or bad, is already in the product. As Harold F. Dodge said, 'You can not inspect quality into a product.'1\n\nMaintaining a high level of quality is not only essential for ensuring our customers have a delightful experience when using our products, but also for staying agile and delivering value at a constant pace. To achieve this level, we do not hand over seemingly finished features to QA for testing. Instead, we work closely with our QA Specialists to apply the right testing strategy before, during and after writing code in order to build a product of high quality. \nWe try to discover bugs as early as possible. This is usually long before we start writing actual code, when we shape our solution. Many issues stem from design flaws and can be prevented by spending enough time in the design phase.\nFor each system we build, we have the test pyramid2 in mind to focus on the right kinds of tests. \n\nWe automate testing as much as possible. We constantly add regression tests to our systems when we discover bugs, so that we can easily prove a fix works as intended and to make sure that the same bug will not make it to production again.\n\n1.

However, most applications can benefit from applying \"Clean Architecture\", a distillate created by Robert C. Martin from various practices he has experienced (or developed himself) throughout the past decades1. Clean Architecture helps us to group our code into layers and adhere to the \"D\" in SOLID: Dependency Inversion 2, which is one key element for keeping our code componentized should we ever see the need to move something out into its own service. The more we build our applications this way, the easier it will also be to find our way around projects we haven't worked with before.\n\n1. https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html ↩\n\n\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle ↩\n\n"},"technical-foundation/trunk-based-development.html":{"url":"technical-foundation/trunk-based-development.html","title":"Trunk-Based Development","keywords":"","body":"Trunk-Based Development\nThis technique encourages (or rather enforces) making many tiny commits towards the main branch of a repository instead of working in long-living (i.e. more than a day) feature branches. Since many features can potentially take a larger number of those commits until they are ready for the customer, we need to work with feature flags (also covered later). It also requires us to have a fast and robust integration process, as otherwise we would risk having (and eventually shipping) broken code in the main branch. On the plus side we avoid \"merge hell\" when trying to integrate large feature branches.\n"},"technical-foundation/test-driven-development.html":{"url":"technical-foundation/test-driven-development.html","title":"Test-Driven Development","keywords":"","body":"Test-Driven Development (TDD)\nTest-driven development has been practiced for way longer than you might think. The code for the Apollo 11 mission was developed in this way, so it's been around since the 60s (find source). TDD forces us to think about what we want to do before writing code - that sounds simple, but it actually is a very brutal change for many software developers (I intentionally did not write \"engineer\" here), as many will rather write code as part of their thought process. This can lead to suboptimal solutions. TDD has very simple rules to follow:\n\n\nYou are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.\nYou are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.\nYou are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.\n\n-- https://localheinz.com/articles/2018/02/01/test-coverage-is-a-meaningless-metric/\n\nAnd as with every rule, there can be exceptions. Even Kent Beck himself does not follow those rules every single time:\n\nI get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence (I suspect this level of confidence is high compared to industry standards, but that could just be hubris). If I don't typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I don't test for it. I do tend to make sense of test errors, so I'm extra careful when I have logic with complicated conditionals. When coding on a team, I modify my strategy to carefully test code that we, collectively, tend to get wrong.\nDifferent people will have different testing strategies based on this philosophy, but that seems reasonable to me given the immature state of understanding of how tests can best fit into the inner loop of coding. Ten or twenty years from now we'll likely have a more universal theory of which tests to write, which tests not to write, and how to tell the difference. In the meantime, experimentation seems in order.\n-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565\n\nThe key benefit of TDD is putting the thought process before writing actual code and that along holds a lot of value.\nThis approach plays along nicely with trunk-based development.\n"},"technical-foundation/many-much-more-smaller-steps.html":{"url":"technical-foundation/many-much-more-smaller-steps.html","title":"Many More Much Smaller Steps","keywords":"","body":"Many More Much Smaller Steps\nThe key to a consistent performance and a high degree of agility is breaking work down into the smallest meaningful (not necessarily valuable!) steps.
